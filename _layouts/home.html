                <p1> 21 years old <br> Male <br> Junior Ux Designer @ Wingman <br>Lisbon</p1>   
                <p>/ <br> I studied for 5602 days, with vacation breaks of roughly 4 to 5 months per year. <br> I wrote, I drew, I painted, I cried, I laughed, I slept, I did not sleep, I did all my subjects in school, I did not sleep again, I missed classes, I arrived early, I arrived late. I filmed, I cooked, I ate, I dated, I worked and finnaly I graduated. <br> My favorite part was eating.</p>
                <p>Now I'm trying to do all of this, but making some money at the same time. At your right you can see some of my work.</p>
                <p> Thank You :)</p>
